our projecy is a POS sytem
A Point of Sale (POS) system streamlines the transaction process by allowing retail 
employees to quickly and accurately scan items, ensuring they are sold at the correct 
price without relying on memory or manual price lookups. This technology eliminates 
the risk of customers haggling or misleading the cashier by enforcing consistent 
pricing directly from the system. By automating the calculation of prices, taxes, and 
discounts, a POS system ensures a more transparent and reliable pricing structure, benefiting both customers and store owners alike.
