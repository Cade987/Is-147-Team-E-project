A Point of Sale (POS) system streamlines the transaction process by allowing retail employees to quickly and accurately scan items, 
ensuring they are sold at the correct price without relying on memory or manual price lookups. This technology eliminates the risk 
of customers haggling or misleading the store owner by enforcing consistent pricing directly from the system. By automating the calculation 
of prices, taxes, and discounts, a POS system ensures that employees do not need to memorize the value of every item, reducing human error 
and improving efficiency. This ultimately creates a more transparent and reliable pricing structure, 
benefiting both customers and store owners alike.
