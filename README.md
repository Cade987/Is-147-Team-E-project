Our project is a POS sytem
A Point of Sale (POS) system streamlines the transaction process by allowing retail 
employees to quickly and accurately scan items, ensuring they are sold at the correct 
price without relying on memory or manual price lookups. This technology eliminates 
the risk of customers haggling or misleading the cashier by enforcing consistent 
pricing directly from the system. By automating the calculation of prices, taxes, and 
discounts, a POS system ensures a more transparent and reliable pricing structure, benefiting both customers and store owners alike.

Javadocs integration 
Our project uses Javadocs. This allows others to understand our code better and understand functions within our code. 
It is like a table of contents allowing outsiders to understand your code an the functions you used in it. 
Javadocs is set up by using the settings pages section and creating an online page.
